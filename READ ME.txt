This study involves the analysis of groundwater level for the purpose of obtaining details of stage of district’s groundwater level. The objective of this analysis is to handle the dataset contains the information on yearly groundwater level of India (district wise) and to identify stages. In the proposed research, instead of removing features of observations with high missing data, Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) algorithm used to handle missing values. The models are developed using Decision Tree , K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest and algorithms to predict the stage of ground water level of district. In addition, the accuracy obtained from above mentioned models used to compare those models.
